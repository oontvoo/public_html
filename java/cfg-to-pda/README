To make life a bit easier in our Theory of Computation class,a friend and I created
a program that  automatically generates the definition of a Pushdown Automaton to recognise
any given Context-Free grammar. The program is also capable of converting a set of
context free grammar rules to Chomsky Normal Form.

The project is hosted on Launchpad at https://launchpad.net/cfg-to-pda
Any comment and/or contribution is greatly appreciated! :)
